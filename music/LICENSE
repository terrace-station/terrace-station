Song Title:		Sculptor of Flesh
Artist:			Pulsipher
Album:			Isip
License:		Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike
Extra Information:	Opening track from Pulsipher's debut album, "Isip". This is more of an experimental piece - it mixes dark ambient with industrial and progressive structure of the track, which includes tempo changes etc. I was aiming for something dark and quite disturbing. "Sculptor of Flesh" is inspired by the character of doctor Demagol, a villain in Star Wars universe. He is a Mandalorian version of dr Mengele and appears in the "Knights of the Old Republic" comic book series. Enjoy!
